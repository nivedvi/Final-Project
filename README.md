This project involves the classification of hand movements using electromyography (EMG) signals.
The key focus of the project was developing machine learning models to automate the identification and classification of different hand movements based on the electrical signals recorded from muscles.
The project employed several machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), alongside an ensemble voting classifier.
The data used in this project was processed using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) for feature extraction, followed by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce dimensionality and enhance class separability.
The classification models were trained and tested using both subject-specific and general data, leading to an average classification accuracy of over 90%.
This repository contains Python code that automates signal processing, feature extraction, model training, and classification, with an emphasis on object-oriented programming for data organization and manipulation.
